### Spark SQL and DataFrames

- Review systems architecture examples
- Review Spark SQL and DataFrames notebook 
  Dataframes
  - The structure makes use of distributed computing
     underlying object is the RDD
  - Use RDDs to perform low-level transformations and actions on unstructured data.
  - If you are thinking about the data by field names, you probably want the data in a DataFrame.
